    <h1>“Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement”</h1>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is accessible to web users, regardless of how old or new the browsers are. It focuses on content, rather than fancy designs and web behaviors. Not to say web designs and web behaviors are unnecessary, they are just not the main focus for browsers. Like layers, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are separated within progressive enhancement. It starts with appropriate HTML(markup language), proceeds with CSS (styling agent that brings out the feeling and design of the page), and finishes with Javascript (web behavioral). HTML, CSS, Javascript are the main components, however web users must still access the web site on mobile devices and other technology devices without Javascript.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Unlike progressive enhancement, graceful degredation can be great for web design advancement, such as fancy Javascript tools. The downside is the website quality on other technology devices. For example, my personal , <a href="https://shutturedindexphoto.wixsite.com/shutturedindexphotos">Shuttured_Index Photography</a> looks nice on desktops, but shrinks on mobile devices no matter how I fix the settings. Now, I know what the problem is and will keep that in my when I build it from scratch. To learn more about progressive enhancement and graceful degredation, you can visit <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-enhancement/">WebFX</a> or <a href="https://www.mavenecommerce.com/2017/10/31/progressive-enhancement-vs-graceful-degradation/">Maveneccommerce.</a> You can also watch several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=progressive+enhancement">YouTube videos</a> discussing progressive enhancement. My personal favorite is the video below.</p>

    <h1>"Space X Reflection"</h1>
    <p>The Space X project was the first website I built from scratch. It involved beginner HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills during Fall 2020. Those skills were not easily put to the test. I learned designing skills, file organization, retracing HTML files for link synchronization, being specific within you code, CSS visual settings, and Javascript programming.</p> 
    <h2>Overthinking the Process</h2>
    <p>Designing Space X was difficult. I had no idea how I was going to create it. I visited the Space X website and tried to get ideas, but since I wasn't that advanced, I left it to them. I drew my design and tried creating it, but struggled with the CSS settings. The HTML was not an issue. The visual part screwed me over. I watched YouTube videos and researched Instagram or Pinterest ideas and still could not implement my ideas. Looking back, I shouldn't have overly-thought the process. Sure I could draw a design, but carrying out the ideas were the problem.</p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Organizing Space X HTML code was not an issue. The basics were not a problem. Classes, ID's, div's were a problem at the time. The more I messed with them, the more I screwed them up and decided to back off until I got it. It took more practicing outside Space X to get the concept. The tables were not a problem. I paid more attention between the table data, row, columns and headers. Still need more practicing regaring #Post, #Bookmark, Containers, and Colophon. Links were another problem. Ran into that duplicating index into history, faqs, contact information. Had one html file called index1 which threw off my other links. Took a whole hour to figure out what I did wrong and will never do that again. Other than that, had no issues with pictures, paragraphs, headings. I also enjoyed sharing YouTube video links and PHP links. That was something new.</p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>I wish I understood CSS way better. I couldn't get anything right. Paddings, Margins, all of it messed me up. Definitely need more practice regarding that because I got so frustrated. Again, the more I messed with it, the more I screwed up. Need to review the vidoes. I understood CSS external linking to the HTMl header. I made more than one because my HTML files were a mess, but whatever. I struggled the most with the back image and logo. I wanted more photos in the header, but still don't understand it. Pretty much, need more practice on CSS.</p>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>I do wish we've gotten further into Javascript a little more. I remembered certain programming techniques from C++, but putting it together was a different story. My CSS settings were not connecting with my Javascript. My photos were not centered and still couldn't understand why. I labeled everything in HTML and still couldn't connect HTML/CSS and Javascript.</p>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Space X taught me persistance. Learning outside Space X made me understand a little more CSS, but still have a long way ahead. Rewatching the videos and YouTubing can help out. I enjoyed new aspects regarding videos and YouTube embedding coding. It also taught me to slow down and be more attentive to things. Mispelling can through off a whole website. Overthinking can slow down the process if it doesn't connect with your skills. Plan within your skills.</p>
    <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <p>I sent the Space X link to four people (different age groups). So far, no complaints. Everyone agreed the website was professional, straight to the point, and easy to use. It was very accessible to one reviewer who was a visual learner. They also agreed the links worked after trying a thousand times, but I tested that with one person before sending it to the other three. Everything was readable, which was good for people that don't care about spaceships. The fonts and colors were not too fancy that they weren't readable. Overall, everyone enjoyed it and encouraged to keep up the good work.</p>
